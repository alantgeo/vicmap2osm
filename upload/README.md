## Clone/improvements for Openstreetmap CLI upload tools

This is a copy of Openstreetmap tools documented at https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Upload.py
I plan to support them working good enough for my own needs, first by fixing problems with deprecation, then by
error fixing. Maybe new features will come later.

The scripts need Python 3, and should use HTTPS API access method.
